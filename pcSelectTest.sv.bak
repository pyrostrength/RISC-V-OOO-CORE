/* 
Test cases for PCSelect Logic
If freeze is active high, pipeline is frozen. No new instruction
is fetched thus fetch remains at the same locations.

If misdirect/mispredict are high 
then preferential choice for next instruction
PC is targetAddress from commit stage.

If misdirect/mispredict aren't high but isJAL
then choice for next instruction PC is validAddress.

Otherwise if there's a hit on BTB choose predicted PC.
Otherwise pick next sequential address ; nextPC plus1;
