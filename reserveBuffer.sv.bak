/*
We maintain a separate buffer
for updating branch predictor and for maintaining
appropriate control flow of program execution.

Written to during writeRS&ROB stage 
with instruction state snapshot info{regStatus,sequentialPC,
previousIndex} and during instruction write
result stage with control flow and predictor update info
{targetAddress,writeBTB,takenBranch,state}.

Uses the same read and write pointer as reorder buffer
Buffer combinations
{sequential PC},{mispredict,writeBTB,takenBranch,state},
{regstatus,previousIndex}
